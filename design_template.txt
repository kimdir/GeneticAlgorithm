# Identifiers
## Values that identify the component as an individual and as part of an assembly. 
## Identifiers are read after the space following the colon. Includes Boolean
## identifiers that contribute to class creation.

Component Name: AnteriorHipFlex
Assembly Name: HipActuation
IsCylinder

# Boolean Identifiers
## Standard identifiers for components, used primarily for informational purposes.
IsAnterior
IsProximal

# Design Variables
## Variables to be generated by the program. Each line is a new variable and should
## consist of a single string of characters with no spaces.

InnerDiameter
CylinderLength
CylinderInnerDiameter
CylinderOuterDiameter
PistonLength

# Calculated Variables
## Variables in this category are calculated based on design variables and should be 
## entered as equations with the DVM. Prefix on all design variable callouts.

CylinderThickness = DVM.CylinderOuterDiameter  - DVM.CylinderInnerDiameter
BaseThickness = DVM.CylinderThickness

# Stress Variables
## Variables here are used in the unified stress evaluation methods. Stress identifiers are set
## by reading section titles and corresponding calculations are located under each section
## title. DVM prefixes should point to DesVarManager, and CVM should point to the 
## CalcVarManager

- Axial
PistonArea = (DVM.CylinderInnerDiameter/2)**2 * math.pi()

# Misc Variables
## Variables in this category do not fall into the above categories but are still used by some 
## processes. Section should be checked regularly to see if variables can be grouped into a 
## better category for code clarity. Section titles should be used here as well. DVM, CVM, SVM
## reference Des, Calc, and StressVarManager respectively.

- Fluids
BoreVolume = math.pi() * DVM.CylinderInnerDiameter / 4 * (DVM.CylinderLength - DVM.PistonLength)
